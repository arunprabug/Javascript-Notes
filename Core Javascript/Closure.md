# Closure

## What is closure ?

Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

```
function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function bar() {
		console.log( a );
	}

	return bar;
}

var baz = foo();

baz();
```

the function `bar()` has lexical scope access to the inner scope of `foo()`. But then, we take `bar()`, the function itself, and pass it as a value. In this case, we return the function object itself that bar references.

After we execute `foo()`, we assign the value it returned (our inner `bar()` function) to a variable called `baz`, and then we actually invoke `baz()`, which of course is invoking our inner function `bar()`, just by a different identifier reference.

`bar()` is executed, for sure. But in this case, it's executed outside of its declared lexical scope.

After `foo()` executed, normally we would expect that the entirety of the inner scope of `foo()` would go away, because we know that the Engine employs a Garbage Collector that comes along and frees up memory once it's no longer in use. Since it would appear that the contents of `foo()` are no longer in use, it would seem natural that they should be considered gone.

But the "magic" of closures does not let this happen. That inner scope is in fact still "in use", and thus does not go away. Who's using it? The function `bar()` itself.

By virtue of where it was declared, `bar()` has a lexical scope closure over that inner scope of `foo()`, which keeps that scope alive for `bar()` to reference at any later time.

`bar()` still has a reference to that scope, and that reference is called **closure**.

The function is being invoked well outside of its author-time lexical scope. Closure lets the function continue to access the lexical scope it was defined in at author-time

Functions can be passed around as values, and  invoked in other locations are

### **Examples of closure.**

```
function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function baz() {
		console.log( a ); // 2
	}

	bar( baz );
}

function bar(fn) {
	fn(); // look ma, I saw closure!
}
```

```
var fn;

function foo() {
	var a = 2;

	function baz() {
		console.log( a );
	}

	fn = baz; // assign `baz` to global variable
}

function bar() {
	fn(); // look ma, I saw closure!
}

foo();

bar(); // 2
```

### **Real Day to Day Examples**

Timeout
```
function wait(message) {

	setTimeout( function timer(){
		console.log( message );
	}, 1000 );

}

wait( "Hello, closure!" );
```

Jquery event handlers

```
function setupBot(name,selector) {
	$( selector ).click( function activator(){
		console.log( "Activating: " + name );
	} );
}

setupBot( "Closure Bot 1", "#bot_1" );
setupBot( "Closure Bot 2", "#bot_2" );
```

## Modules

### Requirements for the module patterns

1. There must be an outer enclosing function, and it must be invoked at least once (each time creates a new module instance).

2. The enclosing function must return back at least one inner function, so that this inner function has closure over the private scope, and can access and/or modify that private state.

```
function CoolModule() {
	var something = "cool";
	var another = [1, 2, 3];

	function doSomething() {
		console.log( something );
	}

	function doAnother() {
		console.log( another.join( " ! " ) );
	}

	return {
		doSomething: doSomething,
		doAnother: doAnother
	};
}

var foo = CoolModule();

foo.doSomething(); // cool
foo.doAnother(); // 1 ! 2 ! 3
```

### Singleton Module pattern

```
var foo = (function CoolModule() {
	var something = "cool";
	var another = [1, 2, 3];

	function doSomething() {
		console.log( something );
	}

	function doAnother() {
		console.log( another.join( " ! " ) );
	}

	return {
		doSomething: doSomething,
		doAnother: doAnother
	};
})();

foo.doSomething(); // cool
foo.doAnother(); // 1 ! 2 ! 3
```

### Modules with publicApi

```
var foo = (function CoolModule(id) {
	function change() {
		// modifying the public API
		publicAPI.identify = identify2;
	}

	function identify1() {
		console.log( id );
	}

	function identify2() {
		console.log( id.toUpperCase() );
	}

	var publicAPI = {
		change: change,
		identify: identify1
	};

	return publicAPI;
})( "foo module" );

foo.identify(); // foo module
foo.change();
foo.identify(); // FOO MODULE
```
### Modern modules

```
var MyModules = (function Manager() {
	var modules = {};

	function define(name, deps, impl) {
		for (var i=0; i<deps.length; i++) {
			deps[i] = modules[deps[i]];
		}
		modules[name] = impl.apply( impl, deps );
	}

	function get(name) {
		return modules[name];
	}

	return {
		define: define,
		get: get
	};
})();
```

Examples using above snippet

```
MyModules.define( "bar", [], function(){
	function hello(who) {
		return "Let me introduce: " + who;
	}

	return {
		hello: hello
	};
} );

MyModules.define( "foo", ["bar"], function(bar){
	var hungry = "hippo";

	function awesome() {
		console.log( bar.hello( hungry ).toUpperCase() );
	}

	return {
		awesome: awesome
	};
} );

var bar = MyModules.get( "bar" );
var foo = MyModules.get( "foo" );

console.log(
	bar.hello( "hippo" )
); // Let me introduce: hippo

foo.awesome(); // LET ME INTRODUCE: HIPPO
```

### Future Modules

ES6 adds first-class syntax support for the concept of modules. When loaded via the module system, ES6 treats a file as a separate module. Each module can both import other modules or specific API members, as well export their own public API members.

By contrast, ES6 Module APIs are static (the APIs don't change at run-time). Since the compiler knows that, it can (and does!) check during (file loading and) compilation that a reference to a member of an imported module's API actually exists. If the API reference doesn't exist, the compiler throws an "early" error at compile-time, rather than waiting for traditional dynamic run-time resolution (and errors, if any).

ES6 modules do not have an "inline" format, they must be defined in separate files (one per module). The browsers/engines have a default "module loader" (which is overridable, but that's well-beyond our discussion here) which synchronously loads a module file when it's imported.

ex : 

bar.js

```
function hello(who) {
	return "Let me introduce: " + who;
}

export hello;
```

foo.js

```
// import only `hello()` from the "bar" module
import hello from "bar";

var hungry = "hippo";

function awesome() {
	console.log(
		hello( hungry ).toUpperCase()
	);
}

export awesome;
```

```
// import the entire "foo" and "bar" modules
module foo from "foo";
module bar from "bar";

console.log(
	bar.hello( "rhino" )
); // Let me introduce: rhino

foo.awesome(); // LET ME INTRODUCE: HIPPO
```
